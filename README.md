Fee Business is a social experiment. The feasibility of building a precious super-deflationary asset. Fee is a self-destructing currency, initially with 10 billion Fee Tokens. After each transaction is completed, 1% of the transaction amount Fee will be self-destructed, and no new Fee coins will be minted. The goal of Fee Business is to become a deflationary currency in a decentralized world.
